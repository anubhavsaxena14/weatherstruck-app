# weatherstruck-app

WeatherStruck application project was completed by me during "Developing Mobile Application on Android" training at NIIT Jaipur.

Created using Android Studio 2.1.3, OPENWEATHERMAP API and Google Map Location, it shows detailed weekly forecast. 

Weather details can be shared by userâ€™s choice of app(Whatsapp, facebook, etc.).

## Walkthrough for the Application working:
In this walkthrough example, we will check the weather forecast at our default location.
Then update the location via the app settings, and see the reflected weather forecast for the new location.
