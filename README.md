# weatherstruck-app
WeatherStruck application project was completed by me during "Developing Mobile Application on Android" training at NIIT Jaipur.
Created using Android Studio 2.1.3, OPENWEATHERMAP API and Google Map Location, it shows detailed weekly forecast. 
Weather details can be shared by userâ€™s choice of app.
